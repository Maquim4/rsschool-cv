## About me

As a results-driven computer-science student, I am committed to developing user-friendly software applications that not only meet but exceed user expectations. 
Through rigorous coursework, internships, and personal projects, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, C# and C++. So, I am comfortable with both front-end and back-end development.
I thrive in a collaborative environment where I can bounce ideas off of others and learn from their perspectives. At the same time, I am able to work independently and take ownership of projects. 
Overall, now I am seeking to grow and develop my own skills as a frontend developer. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to meaningful projects and I am confident that my passion for programming and ability to achieve goals make me an excellent candidate for web-development position.

function getParticipants(handshakes) {
  console.log(handshakes);
  men = 0;
  let delta = 0;
  let i = 1;
  while (i <= handshakes) {
    i += 1+delta++;
